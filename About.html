                   <h1><i><b>About Navia</i></b></h1>
                    <p>Judging from her appearance, there's no doubt that Navia is the very picture of a Fontainian lady.<br><br>
                    She likes to accoutre herself in ornate dresses and fine hats, and carries with her a ribboned umbrella encrusted with jewels.<br><br>
                    Thus bedecked, she flits around the streets of the Court of Fontaine, the slopes of Mont Automnequi, as well as lesser-known spots along the Fleuve Cendre.<br><br>
                    She's never before been hindered by her long flowing dress, nor by her deceptively heavy umbrella. Spry as a sparrow, she is the bearer of glad tidings from the Spina di Rosula for those in need.Perhaps this is why Navia has become one of the famous reporter Charlotte's favorite subjects.<br><br>
                    At the exhibition hall of The Steambird, there even hangs a photo connected to her called "The Soaring Yellow Rose."<br><br>
                    But there's no need to worry â€” for it goes without saying that the photo's subject not only consented to its showing, but also gave her enthusiastic support.<br><br>
