                   <h1><i><b>About Navia</i></b></h1>
                    <p>Fontaine's laws are very strict, but its people are quite free-spirited.<br>
                    Fontainian society contains all manner of social organizations, clubs, or factions, all of which have their own origins, development, goals, and style.<br><br>
                    For example, the short-lived Hat Jellyfish Association ostensibly promoted the protection of the waters and those living within, but was in truth founded by a band of explosives enthusiasts.<br><br>
                    By comparison, the Spina di Rosula are a law-abiding, reliable lot, their overly rambunctious young President notwithstanding.<br><br>
                    In official statements, the Spina proclaims itself to be a citizen-oriented society that involves many walks of life and focuses its efforts on solving difficult issues amongst the common folk, and that it will cooperate with the Fontainian authorities where needed.<br><br>
                    If you ask Navia, she'd tell you that the Spina serves as a business partner with all sorts of people in it, that will help with any problem, using the velvet glove or the iron fist as appropriate.<br><br>
                    Neither of these descriptions are mistaken, at least in broad strokes, so you may choose the one you prefer â€” though it is worth noting that those who choose the latter wording will find it easier to make friends with Navia.<br><br>
